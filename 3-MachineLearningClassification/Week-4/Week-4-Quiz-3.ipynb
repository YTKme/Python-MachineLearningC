    "1. (True/False) Skipping data points (i.e., skipping rows of the data) that have missing features only works when the learning algorithm we are using is decision tree learning.\n",

    "\n",
    "2. What are potential downsides of skipping features with missing values (i.e., skipping columns of the data) to handle missing data?\n",
    "    * So many features are skipped that accuracy can degrade\n",
    "    * If an input at prediction time has a feature missing that was always present during training, this approach is not applicable.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. (True/False) Itâ€™s always better to remove missing data points (i.e., rows) as opposed to removing missing features (i.e., columns).\n",

    "    * Imputed values can be used in any classification algorithm\n",
    "    * Imputed values can be used when there is missing data at prediction time\n",
    "\n",
    "7. Consider data that has binary features (i.e. the feature values are 0 or 1) with some feature values of some data points missing. When learning the best feature split at a node, how would we best modify the decision tree learning algorithm to handle data points with missing values for a feature?\n",
    "    * We choose to assign missing values to the branch of the tree (either the one with feature value equal to 0 or with feature value equal to 1) that minimizes classification error."
