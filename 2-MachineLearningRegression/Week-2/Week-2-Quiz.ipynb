    "4. If you double the value of a given feature (i.e. a specific column of the feature matrix), what happens to the least-squares estimated coefficients for every **other** feature? (assume you have no other feature that depends on the doubled feature i.e. no interaction terms).\n",

    "8. Let's analyze how many computations are required to fit a multiple linear regression model using the closed-form solution based on a data set with 50 observations and 10 features. In the videos, we said that computing the inverse of the 10x10 matrix H^T*H was on the order of D^3 operations. Let's focus on forming this matrix **prior** to inversion. How many multiplications are required to form the matrix H^T*H?\n",
