To choose the penalty strength $\\lambda$, you run leave-one-out (LOO) cross validation searching over $L$ values of $\\lambda$. Let $Cost(N, D)$ be the computational cost of running ridge regression with $N$ data points and $D$ features. Assume the prediction cost is negligible compared to the computational cost of training the model. Which of the following represents the computational cost of your LOO cross validation procedure?\n",
